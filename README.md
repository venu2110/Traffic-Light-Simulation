🚦 Traffic Light Simulation System

A simple yet effective simulation of a Traffic Light System designed using C++, integrating Queue Data Structure and Finite State Machine (FSM) principles. This project models real-world traffic signal behavior through logical state transitions, timed delays, and interactive UI components.

📌 Project Overview

The Traffic Light Simulation System is a realistic, educational, and interactive program designed to replicate how traffic signals operate at a road intersection. The project showcases the logical functioning of traffic control mechanisms by simulating the three major states—Green, Yellow, and Red—with accurate timing and smooth transitions.

This simulation uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage state flow and a Queue data structure to model the movement and waiting behavior of vehicles at the signal. Each vehicle enters the queue, waits for the appropriate signal, and proceeds only when the light turns green, making the system behave like an actual traffic intersection.

The project helps visualize how traffic control works, how vehicles are prioritized, and how signal timing impacts flow efficiency. It serves as an excellent foundation for understanding real-time systems, event-driven programming, and logic-based automation. Whether used for academic demonstrations, DSA practice, or system modeling, this simulation provides a clear and interactive way to learn core programming and system engineering concepts.
This project demonstrates how traffic signals operate at intersections by simulating the three primary states:

🟢 GREEN – Vehicles move

🟡 YELLOW – Prepare to stop

🔴 RED – Stop

The system cycles through these states automatically using queue-based event handling and FSM logic.
